#### Introduction

This work introduces a true multi-frame interpolator. It utilizes a pyramidal style network in the temporal domain to complete the multi-frame interpolation task in one-shot. A novel  flow estimation procedure using a relaxed loss function, and an advanced, cubic-based, motion model is also used to further boost interpolation accuracy when complex motion segments are encountered.
